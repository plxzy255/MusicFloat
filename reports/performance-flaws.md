### PERF-001: Invalid live benchmark evidence

- Status: open
- First seen: PR #11 setup review
- Signal: a benchmark can claim to be live without proving Music.app playback,
  overlay appearance, non-mock lyrics, and provider readiness.
- Affected modes: live profiling
- Evidence: earlier subagent demo-mode benchmark was useful as a sanity check
  but not valid Apple Music live evidence.
- Current mitigation: `script/profile.sh ... --live` preflight and live-log
  verification, `--drive-music` for seek/next-track live interaction coverage,
  run ledger metadata, and `script/profile.sh compare-runs --strict` for
  agent/CI comparisons that should fail on mixed scenarios, invalid runs, or
  tracked-dirty source evidence.
- 2026-05-25 verification: strict comparison rejects incompatible live evidence
  instead of allowing a successful agent/CI exit. Keep the flaw open because the
  missing artifact is still a valid live `--drive-music` baseline/candidate
  pair, not just stricter tooling.
- 2026-05-25 live follow-up: run
  `20260525-080546Z-live-Direct-Sample-28b81d4` used
  `--live --drive-music`, proved Music.app playback, live auto-start overlay,
  non-mock Apple Music web lyrics (`line_count=64`), provider readiness, a
  driven seek/track-change event, and zero provider timeout lines. It reported
  avg RSS 113.69 MB and max CPU 13.9 percent. The row is useful current
  evidence but not a clean regression baseline because the worktree was dirty.
- 2026-05-25 clean snapshot live follow-up: run
  `20260525-142048Z-live-Direct-Sample-52adb7a` came from temporary snapshot
  commit `52adb7a4` with `tracked_dirty=false`. It proved Music.app playback,
  live auto-start overlay, non-mock Apple Music web lyrics (`line_count=50`),
  provider readiness, one watchdog seek, one live-clock resync, and one
  track-change event. It reported avg RSS 111.28 MB, max RSS 114.27 MB, avg
  CPU 5.15 percent, and max CPU 23.5 percent. This is clean current-candidate
  evidence, but still not a baseline/candidate regression pair.
- 2026-05-25 tooling follow-up: live verification now accepts the live
  auto-start overlay path and returns failure if any required log token is
  missing. Short run `20260525-080707Z-live-Direct-Sample-28b81d4` was marked
  invalid because provider readiness/non-mock lyrics were not proven before the
  sample ended.
- 2026-05-25 timeout-summary follow-up: `script/profile.sh` now excludes
  AppleEvent timeout parameters such as `timeout 7200` from
  `network_timeout_count`. The clean snapshot row above records zero real
  network timeout failures after that correction.
- Next check: collect a clean same-mode `--live --drive-music`
  baseline/candidate pair while Music.app can play a lyric-capable track. Use
  `script/profile_snapshot.sh` or a real clean branch/worktree so the measured
  ledger rows are not dirty-checkout evidence.

### PERF-002: Raw Instruments artifacts can bloat disk usage

- Status: monitoring
- First seen: PR #9 profiling notes
- Signal: phased Instruments traces can create multi-GB `.codex/traces` and
  DerivedData artifacts.
- Affected modes: record, phased
- Current mitigation: `script/profile.sh disk`, `script/profile.sh clean`, and
  trace-size reporting in run entries.
- Next check: confirm trace sizes stay bounded after a full live phased run.

### PERF-007: Faster visible-lyrics refresh needs same-mode CPU proof

- Status: monitoring
- First seen: PR #18 follow-up review
- Signal: visible lyrics refresh moved from a 2s side loop to a 0.5s app loop
  with a 0.75s provider throttle to reduce delayed lyric starts, but AX
  traversal can be expensive when Apple Music web and LRCLIB miss.
- Affected modes: live overlay with visible Music.app lyrics fallback.
- Current mitigation: Apple Music web documents skip AX replacement, AX
  observer-driven refreshes keep the 0.5s cooldown, and repeated visible-line
  misses back off to 1.25s.
- Evidence gap: no clean same-mode baseline/candidate CPU pair isolates this
  refresh-cadence change yet. Do not claim it is free or regressed without run
  IDs, usage CSVs, and live logs from matching live scenarios.
- Next check: collect a clean `--live --drive-music --scenario
  apple-music-driven-karaoke` pair, or add an isolated AX-miss scenario if a
  track/provider miss reliably reproduces the expensive path.

## Resolved

### PERF-006: Live AppleScript polling repeatedly recompiles scripts

- Status: resolved in PR #17
- First seen: live same-track profiling for timed lyric progress
- Signal: live Apple Music overlay samples on a syllable-timed track stayed near
  double-digit CPU while lyrics were already loaded.
- Affected modes: live Apple Music overlay, especially timed lyrics
- Evidence: `20260525-051919Z-live-Direct-Sample-1d5470b` on
  "Solitaires (feat. Travis Scott)" selected Apple Music web syllable lyrics
  with `line_count=63` and `syllable_count=702`, then reported avg CPU 12.64%
  and max CPU 17.6%.
- Diagnosis: a local Time Profiler export from
  `20260525-052039Z-live-Time-Profiler-1d5470b` helped identify repeated
  `OSAScript` compile work under XProtect/YARA scanning. That record is marked
  invalid in the ledger because `xctrace` exited non-zero at the time limit, so
  same-mode sample runs are the comparison evidence.
- Fix: async AppleScript execution now reuses compiled `OSAScript` instances
  behind a serial actor, keeping OSAKit work off the main actor while avoiding
  per-poll recompilation.
- Validation: same-track live sample
  `20260525-052748Z-live-Direct-Sample-1d5470b` selected the same 63-line,
  702-syllable document and reported avg CPU 7.13% and max CPU 24.8%; excluding
  the initial launch/provider samples, CPU was avg 6.68% and max 11.7%.
  A driven live sample also dropped to avg CPU 4.19% and max CPU 12.8% in
  `20260525-052533Z-live-Direct-Sample-1d5470b`.

### PERF-005: AX lyrics fallback over-polls on visible-line misses

- Status: resolved in PR #17
- First seen: live driven profiling for timed lyric refactor
- Signal: when Apple Music web and LRCLIB missed, AX fallback notifications
  repeatedly traversed Music.app's lyrics tree while the panel had no visible
  lyric line, raising live sample CPU.
- Affected modes: live overlay with AX fallback and missing web/LRCLIB lyrics
- Evidence: `20260525-045803Z-live-Direct-Sample-e9179a5` reported avg CPU
  11.27% and max CPU 36.9%; its live log showed dense repeated
  `Music.app AX lyrics panel had no visible lyric line` entries.
- Fix: observer-driven AX refreshes now use a 0.5s cooldown and back off to
  1.25s after repeated visible-line misses.
- Validation: `20260525-050037Z-live-Direct-Sample-e9179a5` reported avg CPU
  5.38% and max CPU 35.5%; the startup/provider spike remained, but the AX
  miss burst disappeared from the live log.

### PERF-004: Apple Translation links translation frameworks at overlay startup

- Status: resolved in PR #13 follow-up
- First seen: PR #13 validation run
- Signal: same-mode Release `--demo` overlay samples showed higher candidate RSS
  before any settings or real translation workflow was opened.
- Affected modes: demo overlay, likely live overlay startup
- Evidence: `20260524-233022Z-demo-Direct-Sample-19fc78b` vs
  `20260524-233051Z-demo-Direct-Sample-1e7afcb` reported avg RSS
  85.7 MB -> 121.5 MB and max RSS 118.2 MB -> 148.2 MB. `otool -L`
  showed the candidate binary newly linked `Translation.framework`,
  `_Translation_SwiftUI.framework`, `NaturalLanguage.framework`, and
  `libswiftNaturalLanguage.dylib`.
- Fix: `LyricsDocument` no longer runs NaturalLanguage inference during init,
  the live provider pipeline is created only when live mode starts, and Apple
  Translation/NaturalLanguage framework usage is gated behind
  `ENABLE_APPLE_TRANSLATION` so the default `--demo` build stays mock-only.
- Validation: same-mode 30s Release `--demo --scenario overlay-karaoke`
  samples `20260524-234057Z-demo-Direct-Sample-19fc78b` vs
  `20260524-234551Z-demo-Direct-Sample-1e7afcb` reported avg RSS
  83.7 MB -> 83.4 MB and max RSS 104.9 MB -> 87.0 MB. Follow-up `otool -L`
  confirmed the fixed candidate no longer links Translation or NaturalLanguage
  frameworks in the default Release binary.
- PR #13 HEAD validation: same-mode 30s Release `--demo --scenario
  overlay-karaoke` samples `20260524-234057Z-demo-Direct-Sample-19fc78b` vs
  `20260525-001430Z-demo-Direct-Sample-1c1e8af` reported avg RSS
  83.7 MB -> 80.6 MB and max RSS 104.9 MB -> 87.7 MB.
- 2026-05-25 follow-up: a fresh default Release build under
  `.codex/DerivedData` succeeded, and `otool -L` again produced no
  `Translation`, `_Translation_SwiftUI`, `NaturalLanguage`, or
  `libswiftNaturalLanguage` linkage.
- 2026-05-25 tooling follow-up: `script/profile.sh --apple-translation` now
  creates an explicit Translation/NaturalLanguage profiling lane, the run
  ledger records `app.apple_translation_build`, and strict run comparison
  rejects mixed default-vs-translation builds. A local-only smoke run
  `20260525-074552Z-demo-Direct-Sample-28b81d4` under
  `/private/tmp/musicfloat-agent/profile-lane-smoke.jsonl` built with
  `app.apple_translation_build=true`; `otool -L` on that isolated Release app
  confirmed Translation/NaturalLanguage linkage.
- 2026-05-25 clean snapshot follow-up: temporary snapshot commit `8af2ba8`
  produced clean 30s `--demo --scenario translation-enabled-overlay` rows:
  default run `20260525-082557Z-demo-Direct-Sample-8af2ba8` reported avg RSS
  79.41 MB, max RSS 81.56 MB, avg CPU 0.30 percent, max CPU 6.7 percent;
  Apple Translation run `20260525-082703Z-demo-Direct-Sample-8af2ba8` reported
  avg RSS 75.36 MB, max RSS 77.58 MB, avg CPU 0.33 percent, max CPU 7.7
  percent. The translation binary linked `Translation`, `_Translation_SwiftUI`,
  `NaturalLanguage`, and `libswiftNaturalLanguage`. Treat the lower RSS as
  sample noise, not an improvement claim; the useful result is that no startup
  RSS jump reproduced in this clean pair.
- Next check: repeat the clean default-vs-translation pair after real Apple
  Translation work is exercised, because this demo pair only proves startup and
  overlay cost when the framework is linked but not actively translating.

### PERF-003: Deprecated karaoke Text concatenation

- Status: resolved in PR #12
- First seen: PR #9 review/build warnings
- Signal: SwiftUI warned that `Text + Text` is deprecated in macOS 26.
- Affected modes: demo, live overlay rendering
- Fix: segmented karaoke text now renders through one `AttributedString`,
  preserving wrapping and per-syllable styling without `Text` concatenation.
- Validation: `xcodebuild test -project MusicFloat.xcodeproj -scheme MusicFloat
  -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .codex/DerivedData`
